# Coding-Quiz

# Doing a quiz within a timer really puts your mind to the test.
The motivation for this project was to test my knowledge of everything I have learned over the past few weeks of this bootcamp. Some of these things consisting of using intervals, arrays, and incorporating that into using CSS/etc.

# Things I learned doing this
Some things I learned were how to access local storage from another page, how to use "setInterval", and mainly enhancing my ability to use basic java stuff.

# Installation
